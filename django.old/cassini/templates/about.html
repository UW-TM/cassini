    <h3>Cassini Edge Controller</h3>
</div>
  
<p>The Cassini Edge Controller simplifies the management of edge switches with a logically centralised controller. 
The concept is similar to what is used in wireless networks today with thin APs. The only configuation that needs to take place on the edge devices
is configuring them to point to the Cassini controller.
