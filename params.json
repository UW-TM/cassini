{"name":"Cassini","tagline":"Network Edge Switch Controller ","body":"### Intro\r\n\r\nCassini is an Software Defined Networking application developed at the University of Washington. The goal is to provide the ability to deploy network applications to support edge users. It is designed to provide an open source, vendor neutral orchistration layer to integrate network applications. \r\n\r\n### \"Openstack for SDN Networks\"\r\nCassini privides the automation layer that resides over the network operating system providing a obstraction layer that can facilitate automation of networks and other components. Cassini's model of the network is very high level only consisting of hosts, switches and virtual networks. Applications that require additional state and information can create data stores related to the application but the top level abstraction is very simplified.\r\n\r\n### Network Function as a Service\r\nCassini is constructed like a scalable web application leveraging vitualised infrastructure and the ability to scale in responce to load. It is module with components communicating over open web-based APIs. \r\n\r\nCassini also facilitates net service models where a Cassini negotiates the comunication between an software based application and the switches or other devices which implement it. A Cassini applicatiion could reside on cloud infrastructure such as Amazon AWS but control edge switches deployed in an enterprise or campus.   \r\n\r\n### Network Access Control  \r\nThe inital application to be developed is an Network Access Control application. It provides the ability to have users authenticate new hosts through a captive portal web authentication mechanism. \r\n\r\nCompared to commercial Network Access Control applications it has the advantage of requiring no pripitory interface with the switches or controllers in the network. It can also deploy functions such as a captive portal solely through OpenFlow based actions.\r\n\r\nIt is enspired by the [Resonance](http://resonance.noise.gatech.edu/) Network Access Control software but is not using a some new mechanisms to create a permanant data store and allow for a simplified captive portal configuation.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* [Cassini overview slides](docs/cassini.pdf)\r\n* [SDN at UW Poster](docs/SDN-EScience_poster.pdf) \r\n\r\n### ScreenShots\r\n* [Main Page](screenshots/main_ss.png)\r\n* [Hosts Page](screenshots/hosts_ss.png)\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n```\r\n$ git clone http://github.com/uw-tm/cassini\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Cassini?
